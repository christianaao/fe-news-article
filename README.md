# Community Connection News Application - Frontend

## About this Project

This project is the frontend application of my news article website, created using React.js, HTML and CSS. It is designed to display data using the API I built in my backend project. This app features a range of functionality from viewing lists of articles, to voting and commenting on individual articles.

This project is still under development and is continuously being improved.
